Today is the anniversary of the publication of Robert Frost’s iconic poem
“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” a fact that spurred the Literary Hub 
office into a long conversation about their favorite poems, the most iconic poems 
written in English. 

Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high.
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.

Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high.
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.

Johny, Johny,
Yes papa?
Eating sugar?
No papa.
Telling lies?
No papa.
Open your mouth
Ha ha ha!
